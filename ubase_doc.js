/**

`ubase.js` is a javascript library for removing accents, diacritics
(and more) from utf8 strings.

Many utf8 characters are "based" on latin letters; that's clear for
accents, like "Ã©" which is based on "e", but also for more rare
symbols like "ðŸ…´" or "ÆŽ" ! The idea of this simple library is to give
you back the *base* letter of these characters.

`ubase.js` can be used in node or in the browser. See
https://github.com/sanette/ubase.js

string by their "base" (ASCII) letter; in particular this will

The behavior on malformed UTF8, or non-ASCII UTF8 chars that are not based
 on latin letter is controlled by set_malformed and set_strip.
